        "The second segment of the project involves a sequence labeling task, in which the goal is to label the tokens in a text. Many NLP tasks have this general form. Most famously is the task of _part-of-speech labeling_ as you explored in lab 2-4, where the tokens in a text are to be labeled with their part of speech (noun, verb, preposition, etc.). In this project segment, however, you'll use sequence labeling to implement a system for filling the slots in a template that is intended to describe the meaning of an ATIS query. For instance, the sentence \n",
        "\n",
        "    What's the earliest arriving flight between Boston and Washington DC?\n",
        "    \n",
        "might be associated with the following slot-filled template: \n",
        "\n",
        "    flight_id\n",
        "        fromloc.cityname: boston\n",
        "        toloc.cityname: washington\n",
        "        toloc.state: dc\n",
        "        flight_mod: earliest arriving\n",
        "    \n",
        "You may wonder how this task is a sequence labeling task. We label each word in the source sentence with a tag taken from a set of tags that correspond to the slot-labels. For each slot-label, say `flight_mod`, there are two tags: `B-flight_mod` and `I-flight_mod`. These are used to mark the beginning (B) or interior (I) of a phrase that fills the given slot. In addition, there is a tag for other (O) words that are not used to fill any slot. (This technique is thus known as IOB encoding.) Thus the sample sentence would be labeled as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Token   | Label    |\n",
        "| :------ | :----- | \n",
        "| `BOS` | `O` |\n",
        "| `what's` | `O` |\n",
        "| `the` | `O` |\n",
        "| `earliest` | `B-flight_mod` |\n",
        "| `arriving` | `I-flight_mod` |\n",
        "| `flight` | `O` |\n",
        "| `between` | `O` |\n",
        "| `boston` | `B-fromloc.city_name` |\n",
        "| `and` | `O` |\n",
        "| `washington` | `B-toloc.city_name` |\n",
        "| `dc` | `B-toloc.state_code` |\n",
        "| `EOS` | `O` |\n",
        "\n",
        "> See below for information about the `BOS` and `EOS` tokens. \n",
        "\n",
        "The template itself is associated with the question type for the sentence, perhaps as recovered from the sentence in the last project segment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this segment, you'll implement three methods for sequence labeling: a hidden Markov model (HMM) and two recurrent neural networks, a simple RNN and a long short-term memory network (LSTM). By the end of this homework, you should have grasped the pros and cons of the statistical and neural approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goals\n",

The `text_batch` will be of shape `max_length x batch_size`. You might run it through the following layers: an embedding layer, which maps each token index to an embedding of size `embedding_size` (so that the size of the mapped batch becomes `max_length x batch_size x embedding_size`); then an RNN, which maps each token embedding to a vector of `hidden_size` (the size of all outputs is `max_length x batch_size x hidden_size`); then a linear layer, which maps each RNN output element to a vector of size $N$ (which is commonly referred to as \"logits\", recall that $N=|Q|$, the size of the tag set).\n",

        "\n",
        "2. `compute_loss(self, logits, tags)`: Computes the loss for a batch by comparing `logits` of a batch returned by `forward` to `tags`, which stores the true tag ids for the batch. Thus `logits` is a tensor of size `max_length x batch_size x N`, and `tags` is a tensor of size `max_length x batch_size`. Note that the criterion functions in `torch` expect outputs of a certain shape, so you might need to perform some shape conversions.\n",

Note that if you use `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` then you should not use a softmax layer at the end since that's already absorbed into the loss function. Alternatively, you can use [`nn.LogSoftmax`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LogSoftmax.html) as the final sublayer in the forward pass, but then you need to use [`nn.NLLLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.NLLLoss.html), which does not contain its own softmax. We recommend the former, since working in log space is usually more numerically stable.\n",

You can use the validation data to determine which model was the best one as the epocks go by.
